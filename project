Upgrade journey
1.Terragrunt= 0.14 - 0.31

Terragrunt is a thin wrapper for Terraform that provides extra tools for working with multiple Terraform modules, storing  remote state, and locking.

If  execute terragrunt apply internally it executes the terraform only, in addition s3 , runs as remote state and it can handle multiple variable files  can include and add .so , dependance can be managed in different levels 
For eg: application variable and global variables are placed in different place.
